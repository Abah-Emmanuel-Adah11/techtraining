#SUMMARY OF THE INTERNET

	The Internet functions as a global network of interconnected computers and devices. 
Information is exchanged using standardized protocols, such as TCP/IP. Data is broken
into packets, which are routed through a series of interconnected routers and switches.
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses,
facilitating communication between devices. DNS requests play a crucial role in this
translation process. Security measures like firewalls ensure protection against unauthorized
access, and HTTPS/SSL protocols encrypt data for secure transmission. Load-balancers distribute
network or application traffic across multiple servers to enhance performance and reliability.
Web servers handle requests from browsers, while application servers execute application-specific
tasks. Databases store and manage structured data.
	The decentralised architecture of the internet fosters global communication, collaboration, 
and the secure exchange of information.
